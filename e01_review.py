#    	print(animals[m])
#    	output dog

# Identify the keys in the following code:
# animals = [ "leopard": 10, "lion": 25, "dog":0]

# Which of the following statements defines a list letters?
# letters = ["a", "b", "c"]

# In what way do tuples and lists differ from each other:
# syntax
# mutability
# the collections of data they use
# all of the above

# Which of the following can be used with both homogenous and heterogenous collections of data [select all that apply]:
# tuples
# dictionaries

# mx = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]

# What is the onkey function doing below?
# 		self.wn.onkey(self.h1, "Up")

# The onkey() method takes two parameters which are:
# function call and a key press

# Which is an attribute?
# self.name

# What is the purpose of the code below?
# 			mrna = ""
# 			for i in sequence:
# 			   if i == "T":
